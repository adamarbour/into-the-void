# Void Linux Install Notes

This site documents my experience installing [Void Linux]([Enter the void (voidlinux.org)](https://voidlinux.org/)) on my neat Lenovo ThinkPad X1 2nd Gen tablet. The device was purchased `R2/Ready for Reuse` as a tinkering device but has quickly become my favorite device in my arsenal.

The purpose of these notes is for me not to forget the steps taken to create what I would consider the perfect *nix setup and a guide for anyone else embarking on the same journey as me.

**Why Void?**

This is an excellent question. Here is my reasoning:

- I installed Arch but was unhappy with systemd[^1]
- I installed Artix but it's just Arch with more work
- I was excited about Slackware finally updating (my original) but it still felt dated and I found myself ripping it apart to have what I wanted [^2]
- I've been digging the suckless philosophy[^3]
- I was intrigued with the Void distro pitch - _stable rolling, runnit, musl, and a package manager written from scratch... what is not to like?_

## Goals

I've broken this up into sub-guides that group my setup into logical parts that progressively enhance the experience and bring out the device's full potential.

- Goal #1: Install the base system and be able to boot into the void
- Goal #2: Improve the boot time and get all the hardware working
- Goal #3: Polish the terminal experience before I install a desktop experience
- Goal #5: Setup a desktop experience and eliminate the need for a mouse
- Goal #6: Optimize my workflow and make this my primary device

_NOTE: These goals are subject to change and may be ongoing The sub-sections will be updated as I make changes to my system. I'll put the revisions under a revision section should I make changes after working through the goal._

## Not Covered

These notes do not cover the following:

* How to create and install the bootable media
* How to prepare your HDD for encryption. I used the `Lenovo Drive Erase Utility` for my setup.
* How to dual-boot another distribution or Windows. This is a single distro device.

## Hardware

This device is pretty neat.  Some of the challenging (if not impossible) aspects of this device I want to take advantage of are:

1. The `productivity module` adds an extended battery and additional ports (included when I purchased the device).
2. The `onelink+` docking station.
3. The `presenter module`, which adds a detachable projector
